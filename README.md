### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an advanced AI framework that combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation. In this approach, a generative model is augmented with a retrieval mechanism that accesses external knowledge sources, such as databases or document collections, to fetch relevant information in real-time. This integration allows the model to produce responses that are not only contextually coherent but also factually accurate and up-to-date.

In the context of the Chatbot_RAG project, RAG enables the chatbot to:

Access External Knowledge: By retrieving pertinent data from external sources, the chatbot can provide informed responses beyond its pre-trained knowledge base.

Enhance Response Accuracy: The retrieval component ensures that the generated answers are grounded in actual data, reducing the likelihood of hallucinations or incorrect information.

Stay Current: The ability to pull in the latest information from external databases allows the chatbot to offer timely and relevant answers, which is crucial for dynamic fields where information evolves rapidly.
